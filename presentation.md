# Introduction 

Hi am Juan Colchete and now will talk a little bit about my professional career I started to work with technology when a was thirteen, my first contact was with game development. I worked with construct2 and Unreal Engine, after a while I entered in a technical school and there I discovered how to develop in web and desktop, there I discovered open source projects and how to contribute, the stacks that I work with in the technical school were PHP, C#, web forms, HTML, CSS and after I entered in a tech company called BHS as a software developer, working in dotNet plugins development to Dynamics365, Power Platform automations with Logic Apps, I have made integrations with our customer portal and Dynamics365 CRM, then I go a company that build the low code platform called Fluna, there I worked with Javascript making chatbots in the Blip Chat Platform, and few months later I used the Fluna's platform to develop flows. After I joined in TOTVS as Software Development Analyst and worked with C#, SQL and ERP development.

My professional contact with Blockchain is in the development of smart contracts, I work with in a NFT project that is a RPG using the Open Zeppelin ERC-721 protocol to mint and manage NFT URI and assign to addresses with random stats and rarity, I did a stake reward logic in the contract that allows the owner of NFT stake the character to gain reward in our token from the reward pool,I also developed a Next.js website that retrieves information from blockchain with web3. When a NFT is minted, we use the moralis webhooks with a configured trigger to insert data into Moralis Database, I made a ICO contract to sell our coin also integrated with web3 in a Next.js website. I also give lessons on solidity and Blockchain development in my free time. Currently I give lessons everyday and I have four students.
